  <br><strong> <u>ALTOIDS</u></strong> are a brand of mints, sold primarily in distinctive metal tins.

  <p style="margin-top:40px">The brand was created by the London-based <a href="https://www.smithandcompany.com/" target="_blank" title="company">Smith & Company</a>  in the 1780s.
  Altoids are less widely available in the United Kingdom, their country of origin, than in the US.
  The mints are stocked in Morrisons. Marks & Spencer produces a near identical product called "Curiously Strong Mints".
  Unlike their marketing in the US, Altoids have never been heavily marketed in the UK.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:40px">The distinctive tins in which Altoids mints are packaged are often reused for other purposes.
  They have long been used as containers for household items like paper clips, coins, sewing materials and other small items.
  The tins are sometimes used to house electronics projects.
  BeagleBone, a single-board computer made by Texas Instruments, is deliberately shaped with rounded corners to fit inside the tin.</P>
