<p>Eclipse is a brand of chewing gum and breath mint, first introduced in the U.S.
by the Wrigley Company in 1999 as its first entrant into the pellet gum segment.
However, it was modeled after Excel in Canada, which was launched in 1991, eight years before Eclipse was launched.</p>

<p>Spearmint Eclipse
<br> Eclipse is a brand that promises to give users "powerful fresh breath".
It comes in blister packs of 12, the Big-E-Pak - 60 count plastic container of candy-coated pellets, and the recently added split packs that include 18 pellets.
Eclipse gum is available in the U.S, Australia and Latvia, but are also sold in Canada under the name Excel.</p>

<p>Mints, in metal and paper (Europe) containers, are also sold by Wrigley under the Eclipse brand, as is Eclipse Ice gum.
In late 2007, the American Dental Association awarded its seal of approval to Eclipse sugarfree gum. Orbit and Extra, two other chewing gum products from the same company, also bear the ADA seal.</p>
