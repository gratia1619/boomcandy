  <p>In 2006, it was reported that Hershey had the third largest share of the chewing-gum market and it viewed Ice Breakers as a means of expanding its share.
  As of 2014, it was reported that overall chewing-gum sales were in decline.
  It was thought by some economy experts to be due to the economy at the time and a larger variety of choices outside of chewing gum.
  In 2016, it was reported that Ice Breaker's sales of its Ice Cubes product had increased from 2015.</p>

  <p>Ice Breakers manufactures and sells mint and chewing gum products including, cool mints, peppermint chews and soft, cube-shaped gum that it has branded as Ice Cubes.
  In 2003, Ice Breakers launched Liquid Ice, a liquid filled mint.
  An advertising and PR campaign that centered around Jessica Simpson was also launched to promote the product.
  In 2004, the company released its dual-pack gum and mints.
  Later that year, Ice Breakers signed Hilary and Haylie Duff as the brand's spokeswomen.</p>
